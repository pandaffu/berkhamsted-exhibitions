        <h2>Exhibition Info for Artists</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>The Upstairs Gallery showcases work from local artists and makers from the Chilterns. We are run by The Way Inn Trust, which also manages the Post Office and Shop at 268. Any surplus made through the Upstairs Gallery is donated to the local charity DENS.</p>

        <h3>Location</h3>
<p>We enjoy a prime site in the centre of the busy Berkhamsted High Street, with  considerable passing trade. The gallery is accessed via stairs above the Post Office (unfortunately we do not have disabled access).</p>

<h3>Open Submission Exhibitions</h3>
<p>We run 3-4 open submission exhibitions a year, curated by the gallery. These are usually based around a theme, and are publicised via the website, email and artists’ organisations. For these we ask for an initial submission of jpgs and final selection of work to be exhibited is made from these. Shelf and cabinet space, suitable for craftspeople, is usually available as part of these exhibitions. Current calls for artists can be found on the homepage.</p>

<h3>Solo and Joint Exhibitions</h3>
<p>We offer solo artists shows, or may ask artists to collaborate in a joint show. We will also accept bookings from an individual or group. Please contact us to discuss rates.</p>

<h3>Submitting your Work</h3>
<p>You are welcome to make a submission for inclusion in the gallery by sending us an initial email attaching details/photos of your work. We will reply with a date to come and meet. You will be accepted if we have space and your work fits with criteria in-line with the look and feel of the gallery and exhibition programme.</p>

 <p><span class="star">*</span> Pricing of art pieces is the responsibility of the artist, although we will offer advice if we consider your work to be either over or underpriced. Not all work has to be for sale.</p>

 <p><span class="star">*</span> For open submission exhibitions curated by the gallery, we are responsible for the placement of your work within the gallery space. You may, however, arrange work on shelves yourself. We may select where in the gallery the work is placed for curatorial, safety, security or marketing reasons, and reorganise the display. Artists are to ensure that appropriate hangers are fixed firmly to the work and that no damage is made to the gallery walls. Work must be framed to a professional standard. A hanging rail is provided with hooks and framed work hangs from D rings placed 3” from the top of frame,  and we ask you not to use box frames, as these do not hang well</p>

 <p><span class="star">*</span> The gallery has shop insurance that covers losses including public liability, fire, theft, robbery, flood. However, theft by people legally on the premises (which could include shoplifting) is not covered. The gallery will reimburse artists and makers 50% of the selling price for such losses not covered by insurance. Breakages will be covered by the gallery. We will endeavour to make the work as safe as is compatible with displaying goods to sell, and expect artists to help with this. We do not insure workshop activities.</p>

 <p><span class="star">*</span> We have no storage facilities. We will agree a time for you to deliver your work and hang it, if you are hiring the gallery.  Work must be collected on the final day at the close of the exhibition.  If this is not possible then we will charge a storage fee of £10 per item per day.</p>

            <p><span class="star">*</span> We publicise and advertise the gallery within the resources available to us. This may include special events. However, artists may like to supplement this by carrying out their own publicity. We will not always have a private view for each exhibition; please discuss with us if you would like to organise one, or any other promotional activity.</p>
